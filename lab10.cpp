/*Your grandmother has just come back from the doctor's office and is confused about all the numbers that were used to evaluate her health. The nurse weighed her, took her blood pressure, noted her cholesterol levels from her lab work, and told her to sit down, because the doctor would be in to see her shortly. After half an hour the doctor came in, looked at your grandmother's chart, smiled, and said she was fine. In looking over the report she gave your grandmother, you realize that there could be a market for a program that explains this information to patients.  */
